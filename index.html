		<h1>About Japan</h1>
		<small>by sumaiya</small>
		
		<p><i><b>Japan</b></i> is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of
		the most densely populated and urbanized.About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous,
		<br>
		
		concentrating its population of <mark>125.44 millions</mark> on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into <u>47 administrative </u>prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most
		<br>

		populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.Japan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, the G20 and the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. After <i>World War II,</i> Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1972 but has stagnated since 1995 in what is referred to as the Lost Decades.
